# 🌦️ Weather App

A simple weather checker built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and OpenWeatherMap API.

## 📋 Description

As part of my Web Development Internship with CodTech IT Solutions, I was assigned a project to design and develop a weather application using core frontend technologies. This task focused on applying essential web development concepts such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, API integration, DOM manipulation, and responsive design. The goal was to build a web-based tool that fetches and displays real-time weather data based on user input, using the OpenWeatherMap API.

The primary functionality of this project allows users to input a city name and receive real-time weather data for that specific location. This includes essential parameters such as temperature (in Celsius), humidity, weather conditions (like Clear, Rainy, Snowy, etc.), wind speed, and atmospheric pressure. The JavaScript logic handles all the data fetching using the Fetch API, processes the JSON response, and dynamically updates the DOM to display the weather information in an organized format.

The front-end interface was designed using HTML5 for structure and semantic layout. CSS3 was used to style the page, ensuring a clean and user-friendly appearance. The layout is responsive, ensuring optimal usability across different screen sizes, including desktops and mobile devices. I also applied visual enhancements such as background gradients and emoji-based icons to represent weather conditions, creating an engaging user experience.

To ensure a professional and functional application, error handling was implemented in JavaScript. When an invalid city name is entered, the application displays a clear message indicating that the weather data could not be found, rather than breaking the UI or leaving the output section blank. This helped improve the usability and robustness of the application.

An additional enhancement included the use of condition-based emojis to represent weather visually. For example, a sunny condition displays a ☀️, while rainy shows 🌧️. This not only makes the application more intuitive but also improves accessibility for users.

The project structure followed best practices with separate files for HTML (index.html), CSS (style.css), and JavaScript (script.js). The complete project was uploaded to GitHub, including a detailed README.md file that outlines the project structure, technologies used, output screenshots, and author information, aligning with the submission format shown in the internship guideline video.

Throughout this task, I gained valuable hands-on experience in asynchronous programming, API integration, and real-time data rendering in the browser using vanilla JavaScript. I also developed confidence in working with developer tools like Git and GitHub for version control, project management, and remote collaboration.

This internship project improved my understanding of:

HTML5 structure and best practices

Styling with CSS3 and creating responsive layouts

Event handling and form input processing in JavaScript

Fetching data from RESTful APIs

Parsing JSON responses

DOM manipulation using JavaScript

Error handling and user feedback mechanisms

Project hosting and documentation on GitHub

This project was completed independently, demonstrating my ability to take a real-world problem and develop a practical, functional solution using modern web development tools. It reflects my growth as a beginner web developer and lays a strong foundation for future projects involving API-based integrations, frontend development, and user-centric design.
